The Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, which is one of the earliest algorithms demonstrating the power of quantum computing. Despite its simplicity, it is often used and is the inspiration for many other quantum algorithms even today; it is the basis of the power of the short-depth quantum circuits. Here, I have shown the implementation of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm without using entanglement on Qiskit and test it on IBM Q systems. - _source-IBM_Qiskit_
