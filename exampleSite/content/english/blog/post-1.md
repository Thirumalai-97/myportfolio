I was first introduced to the world of quantum mechanics through popular media like Marvel movies and online videos. As I advanced in my higher education, I found myself increasingly fascinated by the fundamental principles of quantum physics. What I realized is that the actual facts and phenomena, like quantum tunneling, quantum teleportation, quantum algorithms, quantum machine learning, quantum communication, etc., within the realm of quantum mechanics are often more astonishing and mind-boggling than the speculations and mysteries that occasionally surround them. One captivating example of this is the intriguing concept of quantum teleportation.
