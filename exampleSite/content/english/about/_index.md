Currently pursuing my master's in Quantum computing at Indian Institute of Technologies, Jodhpur. My area of interest lies in Quantum machine learning, algorithm and cryptography. Also open to any project in Quantum computing and Machine learning.

If you are at IIT Jodhpur, contact me --> Let's have quantum walk and talk :).
