I am currently pursuing a master's degree in quantum computing at the Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur. 

I'm exploring quantum machine learning techniques. My research interests include QCNN, QGAN, and QGNN. I'm a beginner in qiskit programming and have completed various self-projects in QCNN and QNN.

Seeking collaboration in the field of QML. Aside from QML, I have some understanding and interest in quantum algorithms and cryptography. 

Interest in researching computer vision challenges and applications. 

If you are at IIT Jodhpur, please contact me. Let's go for a quantum walk and talk:).
