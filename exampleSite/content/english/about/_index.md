Currently pursuing my master's in Quantum computing at Indian Institute of Technologies, Jodhpur. 

I am expploring quantum machine learning algorithms. My area of interest lies in QCNN, QGAN and QGNN. I'm a beginner in qiskit programming and have implemented some self projects in QCNN and QNN.

Looking for collaboration in the area of QML. Apart from QML I have some knowledge and interest in Quantum algorithms and quantum cryptography. 

Interest to explore computer vision problems and applications. 

If you are at IIT Jodhpur, contact me --> Let's have quantum walk and talk :).
